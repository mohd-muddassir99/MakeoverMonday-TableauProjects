# Makeover Monday Tableau Projects
Welcome to my Makeover Monday Tableau Projects repository üé®üìä

This repository showcases all the projects I've worked on as part of the **#MakeoverMonday** challenge. Each project is a data visualization that reflects my approach to transforming raw datasets into insightful and visually engaging dashboards using Tableau.

# What is MakeOver Monday
### Makeover Monday is a weekly project that helps people improve their data visualization and analysis skills.
- **Participants**: Each week, a chart and data set are posted, and participants are encouraged to reimagine the visualization in their own way.
- **Goals**: The goal is to create a better version of the visualization, and to have broader conversations about data.
- **Benefits**: Participants can improve their design, analysis, and storytelling skills, and learn something new with each challenge.
- **Community**: Makeover Monday has helped thousands of Tableau Community members learn and grow. 


## What's Inside:
- **Weekly Data Visualizations**: Creative and analytical dashboards based on diverse datasets.
- **Project Overviews**: Brief descriptions and goals of each visualization.
- **Visuals and Code**: Downloadable Tableau files (.twbx) and preview images for each project.

These visualizations not only demonstrate my passion for data but also reflect the continuous learning and improvement in my analytical and design skills.
