# Makeover Monday Tableau Projects
Welcome to my Makeover Monday Tableau Projects repository üé®üìä

This repository showcases all the projects I've worked on as part of the **#MakeoverMonday** challenge. Each project is a data visualization that reflects my approach to transforming raw datasets into insightful and visually engaging dashboards using Tableau.

# What is MakeOver Monday?
### Makeover Monday is a weekly project that helps people improve their data visualization and analysis skills. 
- **Participants**: Each week, a chart and data set are posted, and participants are encouraged to reimagine the visualization in their own way.
- **Goals**: The goal is to create a better version of the visualization, and to have broader conversations about data.
- **Benefits**: Participants can improve their design, analysis, and storytelling skills, and learn something new with each challenge.
- **Community**: Makeover Monday has helped thousands of Tableau Community members learn and grow.
